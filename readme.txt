Search Types custom posts for posts that have user specified values for Types custom fields.

== Description ==
This search widget can search for Types custom posts, WordPress posts and pages by the value of Types custom fields, WordPress taxonomies and post content. It is designed to be used with the Types plugin only and makes use of Types' proprietary database format to generate user friendly field names and field values. The widget uses user friendly substitutions for the actual values in the database when appropriate, e.g. post title is substituted for post id in parent/child fields. Please visit the [online documentation](http://alttypes.wordpress.com/search-types-custom-fields-widget/) for more details. This plugin requires at least PHP 5.4.
